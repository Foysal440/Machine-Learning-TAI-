# Machine-Learning-TAI
This repository explores the intersection of Trustworthy AI and the challenges posed by adversarial attacks in machine learning models. Trustworthy AI encompasses principles of reliability, ethics, and security, addressing factors like fairness, interpretability, transparency, and robustness. In the realm of adversarial attacks, we investigate techniques that exploit vulnerabilities in machine learning models, leading to misclassifications or compromised performance. The repository includes code examples, experiments, and resources to foster understanding and provide strategies for building more secure and robust AI systems.
